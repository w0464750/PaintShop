# LAB 1 - THE PAINT SHOP
# Code a Python program that calculates the amount of paint you need to cover the walls in your family room. 
# The salesperson at the home improvement store told you to buy 1 gallon of paint for every 150 square feet of 
# wall you need to paint.

# Assuming that the room is rectangular in shape, the program should take in as input the width of your 
# two sets of walls and the height of the room.

# The program should output the number of gallons required to paint the room. 
# Paint is sold only by the gallon.

#Purpose/Concepts: Input and output to screen, string concatentation, datatype casting, simple math operations
